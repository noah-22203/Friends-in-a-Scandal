# Friends-in-a-Scandal
I actually had a ton of fun making this project, and I think that it definitely bettered my understanding of class
topics that I was previously confused about. One thing that I ended up having to change about my implementation
was switching to a directed graph instead of an undirected graph. I did this so that I could easily differentiate
sent emails from received emails for the interactive part of the project. I did not get the chance to test
if my file writing part is fully functional, but I know that it works when a file is not provided. I also referenced
some code from geeksforgeeks when implementing bfs and dfs in my code, just because those are two algorithms that
I am still not super comfortable using and need a bit of a refresher to make sure I was doing everything correctly.
My implementation of the extractEmail function was the one that David posted in the class slack channel. I used the
smaller data file to write my code because my computer is really old.
